# waveToColorXY
## Requirements
* c++ compiler
* wavelengths.csv file
* intensities.csv file

## Synopsis

Given data from an optical spectrometer, the waveToColorXY calculates the perceived **colour of the light as a (x, y) coordinates on a CIE-1931 chromaticity diagram**.


## Input data

The program receive two file as input data: - **wavelengths.csv** and **intensities.csv**
###  wavelenghts.csv
This file have contain a sequence of wavelenghts. The file format should follow this model:

Bin Number, Wavelength</br>
0, 450</br>
1, 451</br>
...</br>

###  intensities.csv
This file have contain a sequence of intesity for each measurement(row), where each element corresponds to the intensity(column) of the light at a particular
wavelength. The file format should follow this model:

Timestamp, Bin 0, Bin 1, Bin 2, Bin 3</br>
1, 0.00001, 0.002, 0.003, 0.004, ...</br>
2, 0.00001, 0.001, 0.006, 0.008, ...</br>
3, 0.00001, 0.003, 0.332, 0.012, ...</br>
...


## Output

The program will create two file as output data: - **outputColors.csv** and **outputStandardDeviation.csv**

### outputColors.csv
This file contain the **colours of the light as a (x, y) coordinates** on a CIE-1931 chromaticity diagram for each Timestamp.
The file has the following format:

Timestamp,	x,	y</br>
0,	0.287403,	0.351373</br>
1,	0.283435,	0.352429</br>
...</br>

### outputStandardDeviation.csv
This file contain the average of the (x, y) coordinates on a CIE-1931 chromaticity diagram and their respective **Standard Deviation**.
The file has the following format:

Average X,	Standard deviation X,	Average Y,	Standard deviation Y</br>
0.278315,	0.00457474,	0.278315,	0.005929</br>



## Results

The first(**outputColors**) file we have color for each Timestamp measure.Through this we can see how white is a lamp to the human eye. </br>
The second(**outputStandardDeviation.csv**) file we have the average and standard deviation of the coordinates. Through this we can Determine how stable the perceived colour is over time. </br>

For example, if we use the input files contained in the folder *samples/a*, *samples/b* and *samples/c* to see how white is the light over the time, when we use the program we have the following conclusion:</br>
* for **samples/a**:</br>
The average of X is *0.32203 +- 0.0146276*</br>
The average of Y is *0.339038	+- 0.0203034*</br>

* for **samples/b**:</br>
The average of X is *0.26938 +-	0.0663892*</br>
The average of Y is *0.258008	+- 0.11112*</br>	

* for **samples/c**:</br>
The average of X is *0.278315	+- 0.00457474*</br>
The average of Y is *0.3578	+- 0.005929*</br>

For these three examples, we see that **samples/a** is that has the closest average white (x: 0:33, y: 0: 33) and has a reasonable estabalidade color.</br>
We also see that the color **samples/b** is unstable over time.</br>
Since **samples/c** has more color stability over time, since it has the lowest standard deviation.</br>
